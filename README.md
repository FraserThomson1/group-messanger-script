# group-messanger-script
script that runs on macOS that allows message to be sent to multiple users in a selected group at once in the contacts app--a  feature not included in the original design of the app--users have to send one by one, which is what makes this script helpful for example sending christmas greetings to a group of people.

Users will have to set up a group in the contact app first to use this script.

script can be downloaded and run on the Script Editor app on macOS.
